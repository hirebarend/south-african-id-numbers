## Decoding a South African ID number

A South African ID number is a 13-digit number which is defined by the following format: YYMMDDSSSSCAZ.

- The first 6 digits (YYMMDD) are based on your date of birth. 20 February 1992 is displayed as 920220.
- The next 4 digits (SSSS) are used to define your gender.  Females are assigned numbers in the range 0000-4999 and males from 5000-9999.
- The next digit (C) shows if you're an SA citizen status with 0 denoting that you were born a SA citizen and 1 denoting that you're a permanent resident.
- The last digit (Z) is a checksum digit â€“ used to check that the number sequence is accurate using a set formula called the [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).
